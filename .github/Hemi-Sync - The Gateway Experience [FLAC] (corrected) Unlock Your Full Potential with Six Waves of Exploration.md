If you are looking for a way to enhance your meditation, relaxation, and spiritual exploration, you may have heard of Hemi-Sync, a technology that uses binaural beats to synchronize the brain hemispheres and create altered states of consciousness. Hemi-Sync was developed by Robert Monroe, a pioneer in the field of out-of-body experiences and founder of The Monroe Institute.
