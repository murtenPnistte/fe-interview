404Sight is not only a game, but also a statement. The developers wanted to raise awareness about the issue of net neutrality and how it affects the internet users. Net neutrality is the principle that all data on the internet should be treated equally, regardless of its source, destination, or content. This means that ISPs should not discriminate, throttle, block, or charge differently for any data that flows through their networks. Net neutrality ensures that the internet remains a level playing field for everyone, where innovation, creativity, and freedom can flourish.
 
However, net neutrality is under threat by some ISPs and governments who want to control and profit from the internet. They want to create a two-tiered system where some websites and services get faster and better access, while others get slower and worse access. This would create a situation where the ISPs can decide what content you can see and how fast you can see it. This would also harm the consumers, who would have to pay more for less choice and quality. This would also stifle the competition, innovation, and diversity of the internet.
 
That is why 404Sight is a game that supports net neutrality and opposes any attempts to undermine it. The game uses the metaphor of speed and ping to illustrate the difference between a neutral and a non-neutral internet. The game also features references and easter eggs to real-life events and campaigns related to net neutrality, such as the Save The Internet movement, the SOPA/PIPA bills, the Comcast/Netflix dispute, and the FCC rulings. The game also encourages the players to learn more about net neutrality and take action to protect it.
 
404Sight is a game that deserves your attention and support. It is a game that combines fun gameplay with meaningful message. It is a game that celebrates the internet as a public good and a human right. It is a game that you can download for free and enjoy without any restrictions. So what are you waiting for? Download 404Sight today and join the fight for net neutrality!
